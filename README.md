# ðŸ¦  Infectious Disease Modelling in R

Welcome to the **Infectious Disease Modelling in R** repository!  
This project demonstrates how to simulate the spread of an infectious disease using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in R. It includes model formulation, parameter configuration, numerical simulation, and visual representation of disease dynamics.

 ðŸ“š Overview

Mathematical models are crucial for understanding how infectious diseases spread, predicting future trends, and evaluating intervention strategies. This repository walks through:

- Formulating compa
## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Formulate classic compartmental models (e.g., SIR)
- âœ… Parameter tuning and sensitivity exploration
- âœ… Simulate epidemic trajectories using ODEs
- âœ… Interactive plots to observe disease progression

## ðŸ§® Model Structure (SIR Example)

The model divides the population into three compartments:

- **S**: Susceptible individuals
- **I**: Infected individuals
- **R**: Recovered individuals

The ODEs governing the system:
